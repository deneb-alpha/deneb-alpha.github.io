After a long silence it seems finally the proper time for refreshing the blog.

I don't want to write about the big changes happened from the previous blogpost. Let me just add that the relocation to Germany marked the biggest changes in my life.

I'm far from my family from several months now, the borders lockdown is forcing me to stay in Germany and probably this was one of the reasons that pushed me to have my own custom domain, without nicknames, without other ways to hide my origins.

I want to restart again from myself, from this latini.org where I'll try to share more about experiments, passions, challenges and everything I will like to share with all of you.
