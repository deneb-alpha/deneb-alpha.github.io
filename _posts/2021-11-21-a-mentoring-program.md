***THERE ISN'T A "RIGHT WAY"***

This is probably the first lesson I learned over the years. There's no "right way" to live your life or to take decisions that will have a big impact on your future.

At SUSE I discovered that we can all make the difference and that our diversity is what can empower us more. All those differences will create that unique team able to envision a great future.

Today I would like to share more about an exciting program from SUSE where I'm having the opportunity to be a mentor in. The 
**Early Career Mentorship Program** has the aim to help girls and young women explore their own talents and interests. 

The program is articulated in 10 weeks of continuos sharing and grow, and every week I can confirm that I'm also learning more and more about myself too! 
This is indeed a shared journey where my mentee has a safe place for discussing and discovering new things but what I was not expecting is the amount of "self learning" I'm experiencing during this path.

So... what is this mentoring program about? :)

I'm approaching the weekly sessions like a discussion where I have a topic I would like to address as "ice breaker", for than letting the discussion flow moving in the direction needed by my mentee.

I try to keep in mind how I was at her age and which where the questions, the doubt I had and the answers I was searching for.

As I said there's no "right way", I don't want to give her just answers to a set of questions, but I'm trying to make her curious to discover and learn more, in particular about topics that are not part of her "comfort zone". I'm usually trying to share my experiences together with pointers to resources, websites and other information that could be helpful for her. I'm doing all my best for sharing also tips and tricks that could be helpful in particular at the end of this program.

If you want to learn more, stay tuned, happy hacking and have a lot of fun!
